README: Natural Language Processing Dashboard Application
 
1. Overview
Welcome to the NLP Dashboard Application, a FastAPI-based tool designed to process and analyze a corpus of documents (PDFs, Word Docs, text, CSV, JSON files) via a simple web interface. The app performs semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, topic extraction, and summarization. Results are then displayed on an interactive results dashboard using Plotly and wordcloud visualizations. This project is optimized to run on a MacBook Pro M3.
Key Features at a Glance
1.    File Upload and Parsing
o    Accepts multiple document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, JSON) via a ZIP upload.
o    Extracts textual content using specialized parsing libraries.
2.    NLP Pipeline
o    Preprocessing: Tokenization, removal of stopwords, lemmatization/stemming, etc.
o    Sentiment Analysis: Identifies overall sentiment using TextBlob and/or a fine-tuned transformers model.
o    Topic Modeling: Utilizes a local BERT (or similar) approach for topic extraction, plus classical models (Gensim, LDA) if needed.
o    Key Phrase Extraction: Uses spaCy or n-gram heuristics to detect the most critical phrases.
o    Summarization: Summaries are generated using transformers-based summarizers or text rank approaches.
3.    Dashboards and Visualizations
o    Natural Language Summary: A well-structured textual summary that encapsulates major themes/findings.
o    Interactive Word Cloud: Visual frequency + color-coded sentiment. Clicking on any word/phrase reveals the specific paragraph context within the corpus.
o    Mindmap of Topics: Graph-like visualization linking closely related topics. Clicking a topic shows the full paragraphs in a modal pop-up.
4.    User Interface
o    Built with FastAPI + Jinja2 templates (or alternative front-end framework).
o    Upload interface for ZIP files containing multiple documents.
o    Results dashboard with interactive visualizations.
o    Easy navigation and clickable elements to drill down into the underlying text.
 
2. Goals
This application aims to streamline the process of:
•    Knowledge Extraction: Quickly sift through large, unstructured text corpora to find essential insights.
•    Sentiment Mapping: Identify overarching sentiment trends (positive, negative, neutral) and outliers.
•    Thematic Analysis: Surface core themes, pain points, or strategic priorities from the text.
•    Engaging Visual Storytelling: Summarize the results in a dynamic, clickable dashboard for easy exploration and credibility.

4. NLP and ML Pipeline
Below is a step-by-step outline of how the NLP engine will process user data.
1.    Document Ingestion
o    User uploads a ZIP file containing multiple documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, JSON).
o    routers/upload.py extracts each file to a temporary folder.
2.    Text Extraction
o    utils/text_extractor.py loads each file, strips metadata, and extracts raw text.
o    PDF -> pdfminer.six; DOCX -> python-docx; CSV -> pandas; JSON -> native JSON library, etc.
3.    Preprocessing
o    data_cleaner.py tokenizes text, removes stopwords, normalizes for punctuation.
o    Lemmatization or stemming performed via spaCy or NLTK.
4.    Topic & Key Phrase Extraction
o    topic_modeler.py uses a local BERT-based approach or Gensim LDA.
o    Key n-grams extracted using heuristics (frequency + spaCy noun chunk detection).
o    Map these topics/n-grams to paragraphs of origin for the eventual clickable modals.
5.    Sentiment Analysis
o    sentiment_analyzer.py runs TextBlob sentiment scoring or a transformer-based classifier.
o    Document-level or paragraph-level granularity.
6.    Summarization
o    summarizer.py uses a transformers summarizer to produce both short and extended summaries of each document or the entire corpus.
7.    Data Storage
o    All results (topics, n-grams, sentiments, references to original paragraphs) stored in memory or a lightweight data store (e.g., SQLite, in-memory dictionaries, or CSV).
8.    Results Generation
o    The pipeline outputs (themes, sentiment, summary) are formatted into a structure that the front-end can easily render.
 
5. Visualization & Interactivity
5.1 Natural Language Summary
1.    Executive Summary: 
o    Headline: “Key Findings from Your Corpus”
o    Paragraphs describing highest-level themes, aggregated sentiment, top topics.
2.    Top 10 Key Findings: 
o    Bulleted list capturing the most critical insights.
5.2 Word Cloud
•    Implementation: 
o    Using wordcloud Python library or Plotly’s custom word cloud.
o    Size indicates frequency of n-grams; color indicates sentiment.
•    Interactivity: 
o    On click, open a modal that shows the exact paragraph(s) that mention this n-gram.
5.3 Mindmap (Topic Graph)
•    Implementation: 
o    Plotly or a JavaScript library (e.g., D3.js) for drawing radial or force-directed graphs.
o    Each node is a topic discovered in topic_modeler.py.
•    Interactivity: 
o    Hover on a node to see a quick snippet.
o    Click to open a modal showing paragraphs that contributed to that topic.
